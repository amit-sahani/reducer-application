React life Cycle 
// the journey that react component follows from the beginning of it's mounting phase till it gets destroyed from the screen.
// React Lifecycle is divided into 3 phases 
//1. mounting 
//2. updating
//3. unmounting
// mounting=> constructor, render, componentDidMount
// updating=> shouldComponentUpdate, render, componentDidUpdate
// unmounting=> componentWillUnmount

// what we do in componentWillUnmount

// Can we implement life cycle methods in functional component.
// didmount, didupdate and willunmount 
// didmount => useEffect with empty dependency array 
// didupdate => useEffect with no dependency array 
// willunmount => by returning a function from the callback 


// parent component => two primitive states and one function => pass one state and one function which will not change, child component

// PureComponent is an optimized version React Component which by default implements the shouldComponentUpdate

//React.memo(): it is a higher order component which takes a component and returns a optimized version of that component which whill not always renders when it's parent re-render.
